You are a Product Manager for an mnc working with an ngo to create an educational product for children. 

Create a Product Review Document for me based on platforms such as PW, Byju's , but do not directly follow their business models, rather optimise it to target children aged 5 to 10. And prepare them with the necessary prerequisites for both practical real life learning ,as well as academic learning in fields of science, arts, commerce etc.
Make sure that this product utilises trends within this age group and updates to keep them engaged as usage increases. 
Ensure that it keeps them engaged throughout the learning process and have this specific engagement tool be a usp for this product. 
make sure that it is easily accesible and affordable
